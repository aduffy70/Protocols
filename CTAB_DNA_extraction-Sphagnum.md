Based on the Shaw Lab protocol (S.B.B 11/15/96) and recommendations from Blanka Aguero

# Process

## Grinding and extracting with CTAB buffer

1. Add 2 stainless steel ball bearings to each racked 1.2ml “collection” tube.
1. Sample a small amount of the capitulum into tubes, pushing the tissue into the bottom of the tube. Save the remainder of the plant in a mini-packet and leave with the herbarium specimen as a voucher.
1. Prepare fresh CTAB isolation buffer by adding 0.2% B-mercaptoethanol to 2X stock CTAB buffer. (if necessary warm to get CTAB in solution). Per sample:
  * | 2X stock CTAB buffer | B-mercaptoethanol |
    | -------------------- | ----------------- |
    | 500uL | 1uL |  

1. Turn on water bath (60--65C), and place isopropanol and 70% ethanol in -20C freezer to cool.
1. Get 0.5--1L of liquid nitrogen, in the blue dewar.
1. Carry to the Willis lab (French 3332): the liquid nitrogen; a small, shallow cooler; your samples in balanced racks with holey bottoms; the orange autoclave gloves; and a pair of OLD forceps.
1. In the Willis lab, freeze the tissue by dipping the racked tubes in a cooler containing a small amount of liquid nitrogen (maybe 2 cm in depth). You can hold the rack with the forceps or use the metal centrifuge carrier. Freeze for 5-10 seconds.
1. Transfer balanced racks immediately to the Genogrinder and construct the “sandwich” with the top rubber gasket directly against the caps of the tubes (i.e. no box lid!!). Grind at the 1X setting, speed 500 for 1 minute.
1. Back in the Shaw lab, add 500µl CTAB isolation buffer to each sample.  This is best done on the open lab bench, so the powdered tissue doesn't get drawn up by the suction of the fume hood.  You can use the 1250 multichannel pipette for this.
1. Vortex well to get the powdered tissue mixed with the extraction buffer. Cap the tubes with the tube roller and incubate the crude extract in a 60--65C water bath for 30--60 min.  Place weighted lid on top of capped tubes to prevent opening during the incubation. Gently mix by inverting 2-3 times during the incubation.
1. Remove tubes from hot water bath without dislodging the weight holding the caps on. Set aside and cool for 5--10 minutes before removing the weight. Blot any moisture from the tops of the tubes and reseat caps with tube roller. Spin briefly to collect all liquid in the bottoms of the tubes.

## Removal of proteins with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol

1. Add an equal volume (500µl) of chloroform:IAA (24:1) to plant extract.  You can do this with the 1250 multichannel pipette, if you want, but decant the chloroform:IAA into a glass dish for pipetting (the mixture will dissolve the plastic troughs). Cap tubes securely and mix by inversion (30-50x) to produce an emulsion.
1. Centrifuge balanced racked tubes for 5 min. at 4500 rpm in the plate centrifuge to separate the phases.
1. Remove and save the aqueous (top) phase to clean labeled collection tubes using a p1000, or p200 pipetter (or the multichannel pipette with the adjustable spacing).  Avoid the interface! Measure the aqueous phase to the nearest 50uL (~400uL typical). To reduce DNA shearing use wide-cut pipette tips.

## Precipitation, washing, and drying of DNA

1. Add an equal volume of cold isopropanol to aqueous phase.  Mix gently by inversion.  Precipitate at -20C for 20+ min (30 typical).  Can precipitate overnight if necessary.
1. Centrifuge for 20 min. at 4500 rpm in the plate centrifuge.  Pour off and discard supernatant.
1. Wash pellet with 500µl cold 70% ethanol (pellet will not resuspend).  Spin 5 min. at 4500 rpm to secure pellet to tube side.  Carefully pour off and discard supernatant. Repeat to wash pellet a second (and optionally a third) time.
1. Dry pellet briefly in Speed-vac (~10 min. at RT) or cover open tubes with a kimwipe and air dry overnight.
1. Resuspend pellet in 25uL water for several hours to overnight in the fridge before measuring concentration. (Optional: incubate for 5 min. at 60C to assist with resuspension.)


# Recipes

## 2X stock CTAB buffer:

  * 10mL 1M pH8 Tris
  * 8.2g NaCl
  * 4mL 0.5M EDTA pH8
  * 2g CTAB
  * water to 100mL

Stir on warm hotplate (don't boil) until CTAB is in solution. Store at room temperature and use or discard within 6 months.  

## 1M pH8 Tris:

  * 121.1g Tris
  * 700mL water
  * Dissolve tris and bring to 900mL
  * pH to 8 with concentrated HCl (will need ~50mL)
  * water to 1L

## 0.5M pH8 EDTA:

  * 46.5g EDTA disodium salt dihydrate (ONLY!)
  * 200mL water
  * pH to 8 with NaOH pellets (will need 2.5--4g.  EDTA will not dissolve until pH is near 8. Even then it takes time---gentle heat may help.)
  * water to 250mL
