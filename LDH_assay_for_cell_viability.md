Each reaction contains:
  * 6.7uL Sodium pyruvate (0.01M)
  * 6.7uL DPNH (0.002M “slightly alkaline”)
  * 67uL Balanced phosphate buffers (0.1M pH 7.4)
  * 60uL sample (cells in media)
  * 60uL Phenol Stock (150mM) + Media in one of 12 different ratios

## Phenol/Media Stock : William's Supplemented Media ratios

| Phenol ratio | Phenol mM (with just sample / final in assay) | Phenol (uL) | Media (uL) |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 100% | 75 / 45 | 60 | 0  |
| 75%  | 56 / 33 | 45 | 15 |
| 50%  | 38 / 23 | 30 | 30 |
| 40%  | 30 / 18 | 24 | 36 |
| 35%  | 26 / 16 | 21 | 39 |
| 30%  | 23 / 14 | 18 | 42 |
| 25%  | 19 / 11 | 15 | 45 |
| 20%  | 15 / 9  | 12 | 48 |
| 15%  | 11 / 7  | 9  | 51 |
| 10%  | 8 / 5   | 6  | 54 |
| 5%   | 4 / 2   | 3  | 57 |
| 0%   | 0 / 0   | 0  | 60 |

1. Make a master mix containing the pyruvate, DPNH, and balanced phosphate buffer. Make enough to aliquot into 12 wells per sample and 12 wells for a control. Aliquot into a 96 well plate.
1. Make phenol dilutions in separate wells, add sample (or media for the controls) to the phenol dilutions, mix, incubate for 5 minutes and then transfer to the wells with the master mix.
1. Visualize at 340nm. Record at least 3 absorbance measurements at least 1 minute apart.


# RECIPES

## Phenol Stock (150mM)  

For ~10mL:
  * 148uL Phenol (89%)
  * 10mL Media (the same media the cells are in)

## Balanced phosphate buffers (0.1M pH 7.4)

For ~50uL:
  * 25mL 0.1M KH2PO4
  * Add 0.1M K2HPO4 until pH is 7.4

## Sodium pyruvate (0.01M)

For 100mL:
  * 10mL 0.1M sodium pyruvate (Sigma)
  * 90mL water

## DPNH (0.002M “Slightly alkaline” pH)

For 10mL:
  * 4mg DPNH
  * ~9mL water
  * NaOH to reach ~ pH 7.7
  * Water to 10mL
