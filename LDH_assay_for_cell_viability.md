# Cytotoxicity assay

## Overview

Cells are plated, incubated with phenol at different concentrations and then LDH levels are measured to determine the relative levels of cell death/damage at each concentration. Include 3-4 replicates of each phenol concentration.

Each reaction contains (for 96 well plates):
  * 80.4uL Assay Mix:
    - 6.7uL Sodium pyruvate (0.01M)
    - 6.7uL DPNH (0.002M “slightly alkaline”)
    - 67uL Balanced phosphate buffers (0.1M pH 7.4)
  * Plated cells with 60uL media (or just media for no-cell controls)
  * 60uL Phenol Stock (150mM) + Media in different ratios

## Process

  * Change media in plated cells, adding 60uL Definitive Supplemented William's E to each well.
  * Add 60uL Definitive Supplemented William's E to no-cell control wells.
  * Add 60uL of appropriate phenol dilution to each well (table below).
  * Incubate 2 hours.
  * Add 80.4uL Assay mix to each well.
  * Immediately read wells at 340nm. Record at least 3 absorbance measurements at least 1 minute apart.

## Phenol/Media Stock : William's Supplemented Media ratios

| Phenol ratio | Phenol mM (during incubation with sample) | 75mM Phenol (uL) | Media (uL) |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 100% | 37.5 | 60 | 0  |
| 80%  | 30 | 48 | 12 |
| 60%  | 22.5 | 36 | 24 |
| 40%  | 15 | 24 | 36 |
| 20%  | 7.5 | 12 | 48 |
| 0%   | 0 | 0  | 60 |

Note: Phenol LD50 (at 2 hours) for isolated rat hepatocytes is 12mM ([Moridani et al. 2003][1])

# Viability assay

## Overview

Cells are plated and LDH levels are measured after different amounts of time (~12 hours apart) to determine the relative levels of cell death/damage over time. Include 3-4 replicates for each time point.

Each reaction contains (for 96 well plates):
  * 80.4uL Assay Mix:
    - 6.7uL Sodium pyruvate (0.01M)
    - 6.7uL DPNH (0.002M “slightly alkaline”)
    - 67uL Balanced phosphate buffers (0.1M pH 7.4)
  * Plated cells with 120uL media (or just media for no-cell controls)

## Process

  * Change media in plated cells, adding 120uL Definitive Supplemented William's E to each well.
  * Add 120uL Definitive Supplemented William's E to no-cell control wells.
  * At each timepoint:
    - Add 80.4uL Assay mix to each well for that timepoint.
    - Immediately read wells at 340nm. Record at least 3 absorbance measurements at least 1 minute apart.

# RECIPES

## Phenol Stock (150mM)  

For ~10mL:
  * 148uL Phenol (89%)
  * 10mL Media (the same media the cells are in)

## Balanced phosphate buffers (0.1M pH 7.4)

For ~50uL:
  * 25mL 0.1M KH2PO4
  * Add 0.1M K2HPO4 until pH is 7.4

## Sodium pyruvate (0.01M)

For 100mL:
  * 10mL 0.1M sodium pyruvate (Sigma)
  * 90mL water

## DPNH (0.002M “Slightly alkaline” pH)

For 10mL:
  * 4mg DPNH
  * ~9mL water
  * NaOH to reach ~ pH 7.7
  * Water to 10mL
