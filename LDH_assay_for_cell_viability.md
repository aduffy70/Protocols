Using CytoTox-ONE kit

# Cytotoxicity assay

## Overview

Cells are plated, incubated with phenol (or lysis solution) at different concentrations and then LDH levels are measured to determine the relative levels of cell death/damage at each concentration. Include 3 replicates of each phenol concentration with cells and 3 with no cells as controls.

Each reaction contains (for 96 well plates):
  * Plated cells (or no cells for controls)
  * 100uL Phenol Stock (150mM) + Media in different ratios (or Lysis solution + Media)
  * 100uL CytoTox-ONE reagent

## Process

  * Remove media from plated cells.
  * Add 100uL of appropriate Phenol dilution or Lysis dilution to each well (table below).
  * Incubate 2 hours.
  * Add 100uL CytoTox-ONE to each well.
  * Immediately read wells with excitation at 560nm and emission at 590m. Record at least 3 absorbance measurements at least 1 minute apart.

## Phenol Stock : Media ratios

| % Phenol stock (mM Phenol) | 150mM Phenol (uL) | Media (uL) |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| 50% (75mM) | 50 | 50 |
| 40% (60mM) | 40 | 60 |
| 30% (45mM) | 30 | 70 |
| 20% (30mM) | 20 | 80 |
| 10% (15mM) | 10 | 90 |
| 0% (0mM) | 0  | 100 |

Note: Phenol LD50 (at 2 hours) for isolated rat hepatocytes is 12mM ([Moridani et al. 2003][1])

## Lysis Solution : Media ratios

| Lysis Solution (uL) | Media (uL) |
| ------------------- | ---------- |
| 2 | 98 |

# Viability assay

## Overview

Cells are plated and LDH levels are measured after different amounts of time (~12 hours apart) to determine the relative levels of cell death/damage over time. Include 3-4 replicates for each time point.

Each reaction contains (for 96 well plates):
  * Plated cells (or no cells for controls)
  * 100uL Media in different ratios
  * 100uL CytoTox-ONE reagent

## Process

  * Change media in plated cells, adding 100uL media to each well.
  * Add 100uL media to no-cell control wells.
  * At each timepoint:
    - 100uL CytoTox-ONE reagent to each well for that timepoint.
    - Immediately read wells with excitation at 560nm and emission at 590m. Record at least 3 absorbance measurements at least 1 minute apart.

# RECIPES

## Phenol Stock (150mM)  

For ~10mL:
  * 158uL Phenol (89%)
  * 10mL Media (the same media the cells are in)
