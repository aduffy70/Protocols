1. Warm to 37C: Perfusion buffer 1, Perfusion buffer 2, Supplemented media. Set heatblock to 42C to keep buffers slightly warmer during perfusion.
1. Insert catheter into the inferior mesenteric artery and suture in place. Snip vena cava between liver and heart to allow outflow.
1. Add 0.25-0.5mL Heparin (~875U/kg = 0.5mL Heparin (4400U/mL) for a 2.2kg bird) to a 50mL aliquot of Perfusion buffer 1. Perfuse (17mL/min) to start blanching while preventing clotting.
1. Perfuse (25ml/min) with Perfusion buffer 1 until blanched (~50-150mL).
1. Perfuse with Perfusion buffer 2 until digested (~250mL or when the liver stays dimpled when poked with a blunt tool). During perfusion put pressure on vena cava for a few seconds to inflate liver and assist in cell dissociation. Repeat every 2-3 minutes.
1. Excise the liver and move to the sterile hood for remaining steps.
1. Add ~50mL Supplemented media and release hepatocytes by breaking the glissons capsule and gently probing with a cell scraper.
1. Filter through cheesecloth to separate the undigested tissue. Pour ~50mL Supplemented medium over the undigested liver in the cheesecloth to maximize cell yield. Discard undigested tissue with cheesecloth.
1. Into 50mL falcon tubes, filter with nylon-mesh filters of pore sizes 100 (or 70um), and 40um to eliminate cell aggregates (turkey hepatocyctes are ~18uM—3 times smaller than mammalian hepatocytes).
1. Pellet hepatocytes by centrifugation (3 minutes @ 200g). Discard supernatant.
1. Gently resuspend cells in 15-20mL Supplemented media. Too "syrupy" and it won't separate well on the percoll gradient; too thin and bands won't be detectable.
1. Make layered percoll gradients (1 per 5mL of resuspended cells). In a 15mL falcon tube, use a 2mL glass pipette to slowly and carefully insert each layer at the bottom (pushing previous layers up) in the following order:
  * resuspended cells ~5mL
  * 17.5% 2mL
  * 20% 2mL
  * 22.5% 2mL
  * 25% 1.5mL
  * 45% ~1mL
1. Pellet hepatocytes by centrifugation (10 minutes @ 100g). 5 floating bands (and possibly a pellet at the tip of the tube) will form: 17% band, 20% band, 22.5% band, 25% band, 25/45 boundary band.
1. Discard 17% band, 20% band, and supernatant down to the top of the 22.5% band (more debris than cells). Keep the 22.5% band, 25% band, 25/45 boundary band, and supernatant down to the clear 45% percoll layer (more cells than debris). Discard the clear 45% percoll and tip pellet (more red blood cells than hepatocytes). Combine the retained portions from multiple gradients in a single 50mL falcon tube.
1. Wash away remaining percoll by adding ~20mL Supplemented media and spinning 3 minutes @ 200g. Discard supernatant.
1. Wash away more debris by adding ~5mL Supplemented media and settling at 37C for 5 minutes. Discard the supernatant. Repeat.
1. Gently resuspend and adjust volume of hepatocytes to ~2-5mL with Supplemented media.
1. Count cells and determine viability with hemocytometer and trypan blue.
1. Plate ~70000 cells/well with 200uL Supplemented medium in 96-well plates. Incubate at 37C.
1. Warm to 37C: Supplemented media, Definitive media.
1. After 2 to 3 h remove media from plated cells, gently wash cells once with Supplemented media, and add 200uL of Definitive media. Incubate.
1. Change media every other day.

# RECIPES

## 5X Perfusion buffer (HBSS + HEPES)
136mM Sodium Chloride, 25mM HEPES, 5.5mM D-Glucose, 5.4mM Potassium Chloride, 4.2mM Sodium Bicarbonate, 0.9mM Magnesium Chloride, 0.5mM Magnesium Sulphate, 0.5mM EDTA, 0.45mM Potassium Phosphate, 0.35mM Sodium Phosphate, pH 7.4

  * 40g Sodium Chloride
  * 29.8g HEPES
  * 5.0g D-Glucose
  * 2.0g Potassium Chloride
  * 1.8g Sodium Bicarbonate
  * 915mg Magnesium Chloride hexahydrate
  * 730mg EDTA
  * 510mg Magnesium Sulphate heptahydrate
  * 470mg Sodium Phosphate dibasic
  * 305mg Potassium Phosphate monobasic
  * Add water to 950mL
  * Raise pH to 7.4 with NaOH.
  * Add water to 1L.

## Perfusion buffer 1
1X HBSS + HEPES pH 7.4
  * 120mL 5X Perfusion buffer
  * 480mL water
  * Adjust pH to 7.4
  * Filter-sterilize.

## Perfusion buffer 2
1X HBSS + HEPES, 1.3mM Calcium Chloride, ~5U/mL collagenase type 4, pH 7.4

  * 43mg Calcium Chloride in 300mL Perfusion buffer 1
  * Mix to dissolve completely.
  * Adjust pH to 7.4
  * Filter-sterilize.
  * Add 5mg collagenase type 4 (~305U/mg) just before use.

## Supplemented media
100U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 10ug/mL insulin

  * 250 mL William’s E media
  * 2.5mL penicillin/streptomycin
  * 2.5mg insulin

## Definitive media
1ug/mL glucagon, 100ug/mL transferrin, 0.4ug/mL dexamethasone

  * 23.25mL Supplemented media
  * 150uL glucagon (stock = 200ug/mL)
  * 6mL transferrin (stock = 500ug/mL)
  * 600uL dexamethasone (stock = 20ug/mL)

## Diluted Percoll
To make Stock Isotonic Percoll (SIP):
  * 90mL stock Percoll
  * 10mL 1.5M NaCl
  * Do this in the hood to keep the stock bottle of percoll sterile

To make Diluted Percoll (45%):
  * 100mL SIP
  * 100mL 1X HBSS + HEPES
  * Adjust pH to 7.4 with 30% HCl (it should take ~250uL).
  * Note- Only use exactly 30% HCL for this! If you use a stronger or weaker solution the final percoll% will be different. Even small changes to the percoll% will have large effects on the size and cleanliness of the cell pellet.

To make additional dilutions from 45% percoll for a layered percoll gradient:

| % percoll | Add 45% percoll | add Supplemented media |
| --------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 25%  | 5.6mL  | 4.4mL |
| 22.5% | 5mL  | 5mL |
| 20% | 4.4mL | 5.6mL |
| 17.5% | 3.8mL | 6.2mL |
