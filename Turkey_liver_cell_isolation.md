Adapted from Fraslin Cell Isolation Protocol

1. Warm to 37C: Perfusion buffer 1, Perfusion buffer 2, Supplemented William’s E media. Set heatblock to 42C to keep buffers slightly warmer during perfusion.
1. Insert catheter into the inferior mesenteric artery and suture in place. Suture the superior mesentery artery to prevent backflow. Snip vena cava between liver and heart to allow outflow.
1. Add 0.25-0.5mL Heparin (~875U/kg = 0.5mL Heparin (4400U/mL) for a 2.2kg bird) to a 50mL aliquot of Perfusion buffer 1. Perfuse (17mL/min) to start blanching while preventing clotting.
1. Perfuse (25ml/min) with Perfusion buffer 1 until blanched (~50-150mL).
1. Perfuse with Perfusion buffer 2 until digested (~300mL or when the liver stays dimpled when poked with a blunt tool). During perfusion put pressure on vena cava for a few seconds to inflate liver and assist in cell dissociation. Repeat every 2-3 minutes.
1. Excise the liver, transfer to Supplemented William’s E media (~50mL), and move to the sterile hood for remaining steps.
1. Release hepatocytes by breaking the glissons capsule and gently probing with a cell scraper.
1. Filter through cheesecloth to separate the undigested tissue. Pour ~50mL Supplemented William’s E medium over the undigested liver in the cheesecloth to maximize cell yield. Discard undigested tissue with cheesecloth.
1. Filter with nylon-mesh filters of pore sizes 100, and 70um, and 40um to eliminate cell aggregates (turkey hepatocyctes are ~18uM--3 times smaller than mammalian hepatocytes).
1. Place cells in 37C water bath to sediment for 20 min. Keep the sediment. Discard the supernatant (contains red blood cells and stripped hepatocyte nuclei).
1. Resuspend cells in exactly 25mL Supplemented Willam's E. Add exactly 25mL cold (4C) Diluted percoll and mix gently but thoroughly by inverting. Even small differences in the media:percoll ratio can have large effects on cell pellet size and cleanliness. (Too little percoll = large dirty pellet; Too much percoll = small pellet)
1. Pellet hepatocytes by low-speed centrifugation (10 minutes @ 100g). Discard supernatant.
1. Resuspend and adjust volume of hepatocytes to ~1-5mL with Supplemented Willam's E media.
1. Count cells and determine viability with hemocytometer and trypan blue.
1. Plate XX cells/cm with 100uL Supplemented William’s E medium in 96-well plates. Incubate at 37C.
1. Warm to 37C: Supplemented William's E media, Definitive media.
1. After 2 to 3 h remove media from plated cells, gently wash cells once with Supplemented William's E, and add 100uL of definitive media. Incubate.
1. Change media every other day.

# RECIPES

## 5X Perfusion buffer (HBSS + HEPES)
136mM Sodium Chloride, 25mM HEPES, 5.5mM D-Glucose, 5.4mM Potassium Chloride, 4.2mM Sodium Bicarbonate, 0.9mM Magnesium Chloride, 0.5mM Magnesium Sulphate, 0.5mM EDTA, 0.45mM Potassium Phosphate, 0.35mM Sodium Phosphate, pH 7.4

  * 40g Sodium Chloride
  * 29.8g HEPES
  * 5.0g D-Glucose
  * 2.0g Potassium Chloride
  * 1.8g Sodium Bicarbonate
  * 915mg Magnesium Chloride hexahydrate
  * 730mg EDTA
  * 510mg Magnesium Sulphate heptahydrate
  * 470mg Sodium Phosphate dibasic
  * 305mg Potassium Phosphate monobasic
  * Add water to 950mL
  * Raise pH to 7.4 with NaOH.
  * Add water to 1L.

## Perfusion buffer 1
1X HBSS + HEPES pH 7.4
  * 120mL 5X Perfusion buffer
  * 480mL water
  * Adjust pH to 7.4
  * Filter-sterilize.

## Perfusion buffer 2
1X HBSS + HEPES, 1.3mM Calcium Chloride, ~5U/mL collagenase type 4, pH 7.4

  * 43mg Calcium Chloride in 350mL Perfusion buffer 1
  * Mix to dissolve completely.
  * Adjust pH to 7.4
  * Filter-sterilize.
  * Add 4mg collagenase type 4 (~375U/mg) just before use.

## Supplemented William’s E media
100U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 10ug/mL insulin

  * 250 mL William’s E media
  * 2.5mL penicillin/streptomycin
  * 2.5mg insulin

## Definitive media
1ug/mL glucagon, 100ug/mL transferrin, 0.4ug/mL dexamethasone

  * 23.25mL Supplemented William’s E media
  * 150uL glucagon (stock = 200ug/mL)
  * 6mL transferrin (stock = 500ug/mL)
  * 600uL dexamethasone (stock = 20ug/mL)

## Diluted Percoll (45%)
To make Stock Isotonic Percoll (SIP):
  * 90mL stock Percoll
  * 10mL 1.5M NaCl
  * Do this in the hood to keep the stock bottle of percoll sterile

To make Diluted Percoll (45%):
  * 100mL SIP
  * 100mL 1X HBSS + HEPES
  * Adjust pH to 7.4 with 30% HCl (it should take ~250uL).
  * Note- Only use exactly 30% HCL for this! If you use a stronger or weaker solution the final percoll% will be different. Even small changes to the percoll% will have large effects on the size and cleanliness of the cell pellet.
