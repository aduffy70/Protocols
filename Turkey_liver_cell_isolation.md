Adapted from Fraslin Cell Isolation Protocol

1. Warm to 37C: HEPES buffer 1, HEPES buffer 2, “Standard” HEPES buffer, Supplemented William’s E media.
2. Insert catheter into the portal vein and place two sutures to prevent backflow along the vein and back down the intersecting vein. Snip between liver and heart to allow outflow.
3. Add 0.5-1.0mL Heparin (~875U/kg = 0.5mL Heparin (4400U/mL) for a 2.2kg bird) to a 50mL aliquot of HEPES Buffer 1. Perfuse (17mL/min) to start blanching while preventing clotting.
4. Perfuse (17ml/min) with HEPES buffer 1 until blanched (~50-150mL).
5. Perfuse with HEPES buffer 2 until digested (~300mL).
6. Excise the liver, transfer to Supplemented William’s E media (~100mL), and move to the sterile hood for remaining steps.
7. Release hepatocytes by gently breaking up the liver with a scalpel.
8. Filter through cheesecloth to separate the undigested tissue. Pour ~100mL Supplemented William’s E medium over the undigested liver in the cheesecloth to maximize cell yield.
9. Filter with nylon-mesh filters of pore sizes 100, and 70um to eliminate cell aggregates (turkey hepatocyctes are ~18uM--3 times smaller than mammalian hepatocytes).
11. Pellet hepatocytes and red blood cells by low-speed centrifugation (2 minutes @ 100g).
12. Gently swirl to resuspend cell pellet (while leaving red blood cells adhered to the tube--they stick more securely than the hepatocytes) and transfer hepatocytes to a new tube. Adjust volume to ~10mL with Supplemented Willam's E media.
13. Count cells and determine viability with Invitrogen Countess.
14. Plate XX cells/cm with 100uL Supplemented William’s E medium in 96-well plates. Incubate at 37C.
15. Warm to 37C: phosphate buffered saline buffer, Definitive media.
16. After 2 to 3 h remove medium from plated cells, gently wash cells once with phosphate buffered saline buffer, and add 100uL of definitive media. Incubate.
17. Change media daily.

# RECIPES

## “Standard” HEPES buffer
25mM HEPES, pH 7.5

  * 4.2g HEPES in ~650mL water
  * Raise pH to 7.5 with NaOH.
  * Add water to 700mL.

## HEPES buffer 1
25mM HEPES, 0.25mM EDTA, pH 7.5

  * 350mL “Standard” HEPES buffer
  * Filter-sterilize.
  * (We don’t add EDTA anymore so HEPES buffer 1 is just “Standard” HEPES buffer)

## HEPES buffer 2
25mM HEPES, 5mM CaCl2, ~10U/mL collagenase type 4, pH 7.5

  * 210mg CaCl2 in 350mL “Standard” HEPES buffer
  * Mix to dissolve completely.
  * Filter-sterilize.
  * Add 9mg collagenase (~375U/mg) just before use.

## Supplemented William’s E media
100U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 10ug/mL insulin

  * 250 mL William’s E media
  * 2.5mL penicillin/streptomycin
  * 2.5mg insulin

## Definitive media
1ug/mL glucagon, 100ug/mL transferrin, 0.4ug/mL dexamethasone

  * 23.25mL Supplemented William’s E media
  * 150uL glucagon (stock = 200ug/mL)
  * 6mL transferrin (stock = 500ug/mL)
  * 600uL dexamethasone (stock = 20ug/mL)
