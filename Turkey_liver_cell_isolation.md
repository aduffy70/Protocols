Adapted from Fraslin Cell Isolation Protocol

1. Warm to 37C: Perfusion buffer 1, Perfusion buffer 2, Supplemented William’s E media. Set heatblock to 42C to keep buffers slightly warmer during perfusion.
1. Insert catheter into the inferior mesenteric artery and suture in place. Snip vena cava between liver and heart to allow outflow.
1. Add 0.25-0.5mL Heparin (~875U/kg = 0.5mL Heparin (4400U/mL) for a 2.2kg bird) to a 50mL aliquot of Perfusion buffer 1. Perfuse (17mL/min) to start blanching while preventing clotting.
1. Perfuse (25ml/min) with Perfusion buffer 1 until blanched (~50-150mL).
1. Perfuse with Perfusion buffer 2 until digested (~250mL or when the liver stays dimpled when poked with a blunt tool). During perfusion put pressure on vena cava for a few seconds to inflate liver and assist in cell dissociation. Repeat every 2-3 minutes.
1. Excise the liver, transfer to Supplemented William’s E media (~50mL), and move to the sterile hood for remaining steps.
1. Release hepatocytes by breaking the glissons capsule and gently probing with a cell scraper.
1. Filter through cheesecloth to separate the undigested tissue. Pour ~50mL Supplemented William’s E medium over the undigested liver in the cheesecloth to maximize cell yield. Discard undigested tissue with cheesecloth.
1. Into a 50mL falcon tube, filter with nylon-mesh filters of pore sizes 100, and 70um, and 40um to eliminate cell aggregates (turkey hepatocyctes are ~18uM—3 times smaller than mammalian hepatocytes).
1. Pellet hepatocytes by centrifugation (3 minutes @ 200g). Discard supernatant.
1. Gently resuspend cells in ~5mL Supplemented Willam’s E.
1. Make a layered percoll gradient. In a 15mL falcon tube, use a 2mL glass pipette to slowly and carefully insert each layer at the bottom (pushing previous layers up) in the following order:
  * sample
  * 17.5% 2mL
  * 20% 2mL
  * 22.5% 2mL
  * 45% 1mL
1. Pellet hepatocytes by centrifugation (10 minutes @ 100g). Discard fluffy debris in the upper layers and red blood cells at the bottom of the tube. Keep the layer of clean cells toward the bottom.
1. Wash by adding ~10mL Supplemented William’s E media and spinning 3 minutes @ 200g. Discard supernatant.
1. Gently resuspend pellet and adjust volume of hepatocytes to ~1-5mL with Supplemented Willam’s E media.
1. Count cells and determine viability with hemocytometer and trypan blue.
1. Plate ~70000 cells/well with 200uL Supplemented William’s E medium in 96-well plates. Incubate at 37C.
1. Warm to 37C: Supplemented William’s E media, Definitive media.
1. After 2 to 3 h remove media from plated cells, gently wash cells once with Supplemented William’s E, and add 200uL of definitive media. Incubate.
1. Change media every other day.

# RECIPES

## 5X Perfusion buffer (HBSS + HEPES)
136mM Sodium Chloride, 25mM HEPES, 5.5mM D-Glucose, 5.4mM Potassium Chloride, 4.2mM Sodium Bicarbonate, 0.9mM Magnesium Chloride, 0.5mM Magnesium Sulphate, 0.5mM EDTA, 0.45mM Potassium Phosphate, 0.35mM Sodium Phosphate, pH 7.4

  * 40g Sodium Chloride
  * 29.8g HEPES
  * 5.0g D-Glucose
  * 2.0g Potassium Chloride
  * 1.8g Sodium Bicarbonate
  * 915mg Magnesium Chloride hexahydrate
  * 730mg EDTA
  * 510mg Magnesium Sulphate heptahydrate
  * 470mg Sodium Phosphate dibasic
  * 305mg Potassium Phosphate monobasic
  * Add water to 950mL
  * Raise pH to 7.4 with NaOH.
  * Add water to 1L.

## Perfusion buffer 1
1X HBSS + HEPES pH 7.4
  * 120mL 5X Perfusion buffer
  * 480mL water
  * Adjust pH to 7.4
  * Filter-sterilize.

## Perfusion buffer 2
1X HBSS + HEPES, 1.3mM Calcium Chloride, ~5U/mL collagenase type 4, pH 7.4

  * 43mg Calcium Chloride in 300mL Perfusion buffer 1
  * Mix to dissolve completely.
  * Adjust pH to 7.4
  * Filter-sterilize.
  * Add 5mg collagenase type 4 (~305U/mg) just before use.

## Supplemented William’s E media
100U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 10ug/mL insulin

  * 250 mL William’s E media
  * 2.5mL penicillin/streptomycin
  * 2.5mg insulin

## Definitive media
1ug/mL glucagon, 100ug/mL transferrin, 0.4ug/mL dexamethasone

  * 23.25mL Supplemented William’s E media
  * 150uL glucagon (stock = 200ug/mL)
  * 6mL transferrin (stock = 500ug/mL)
  * 600uL dexamethasone (stock = 20ug/mL)

## Diluted Percoll
To make Stock Isotonic Percoll (SIP):
  * 90mL stock Percoll
  * 10mL 1.5M NaCl
  * Do this in the hood to keep the stock bottle of percoll sterile

To make Diluted Percoll (45%):
  * 100mL SIP
  * 100mL 1X HBSS + HEPES
  * Adjust pH to 7.4 with 30% HCl (it should take ~250uL).
  * Note- Only use exactly 30% HCL for this! If you use a stronger or weaker solution the final percoll% will be different. Even small changes to the percoll% will have large effects on the size and cleanliness of the cell pellet.

To make additional dilutions from 45% percoll for a layered percoll gradient:

| % percoll | Add 45% percoll | add Supplemented William’s media |
| --------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 22.5% | 5mL  | 5mL |
| 20% | 4.4mL | 5.4mL |
| 17.5% | 3.8mL | 6.2mL |
