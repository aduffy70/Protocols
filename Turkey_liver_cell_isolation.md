# Turkey liver cell isolation protocol
Adapted from Fraslin Cell Isolation Protocol

1. Warm to 37C: HEPES buffer 1, HEPES buffer 2, “Standard” HEPES buffer, Supplemented William’s E medium.
2. Insert catheter into the portal vein and place two sutures to prevent backflow along the vein and back down the intersecting vein. Snip between liver and heart to allow outflow.
3. Perfuse (17ml/min) with HEPES buffer 1 until blanched (~250mL).
4. Perfuse with HEPES buffer 2 until digested (~300mL).
5. Excise the liver, transfer to Supplemented William’s E medium (50mL), and move to the sterile hood for remaining steps.
6. Release hepatocytes by gently breaking up the liver with a blunt spatula.
7. Filter through cheesecloth to separate the undigested tissue. Pour 50-100mL Supplemented William’s E medium over the undigested liver in the cheesecloth to maximize cell yield.
8. Filter with nylon-mesh filters of pore sizes 100, 70, and 40um to eliminate cell aggregates (N.B.: chicken hepatocytes are 3 times smaller than mammalian hepatocytes).
9. Place cells in 37C water bath to sediment for 20 min. Discard the supernatant.
10. Wash 3 times by low-speed centrifugation (3 minutes @70g/600rpm) in 50mL “Standard” HEPES buffer to eliminate cell debris, blood, and nonparenchymal cells.
11. Resuspend cell pellet in ~5mL Supplemented William’s E media.
12. Count cells and determine viability with Invitrogen Countess.
13. Plate XX cells/cm with XX mL Supplemented William’s E medium in    XX-well plates. Incubate at 37C.
14. Warm to 37C: phosphate buffered saline buffer, Definitive medium.
15. After 2 to 3 h remove medium from plated cells, gently wash cells twice with phosphate buffered saline buffer, and add XX ml of definitive culture medium. Incubate.
16. Change media daily.

# RECIPES

## “Standard” HEPES buffer
25mM HEPES, pH 7.5

  * 4.2g HEPES in ~650mL water
  * Raise pH to 7.5 with NaOH.
  * Add water to 700mL.

## HEPES buffer 1
25mM HEPES, 0.25mM EDTA, pH 7.5

  * 350mL “Standard” HEPES buffer
  * Filter-sterilize.
  * (We don’t add EDTA anymore so HEPES buffer 1 is just “Standard” HEPES buffer)

## HEPES buffer 2
25mM HEPES, 5mM CaCl2, ~21U/mL collagenase type 2, pH 7.5

  * 210mg CaCl2 in 350mL “Standard” HEPES buffer
  * Mix to dissolve completely.
  * Filter-sterilize.
  * Add 25mg collagenase just before use.

## Supplemented William’s E media
100U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 10ug/mL insulin

  * 250 mL William’s E media
  * 2.5mL penicillin/streptomycin
  * 2.5mg insulin

## Definitive media
1ug/mL glucagon, 100ug/mL transferrin, 0.4ug/mL dexamethasone

  * 23.25mL Supplemented William’s E media
  * 150uL glucagon (stock = 200ug/mL)
  * 6mL transferrin (stock = 500ug/mL)
  * 600uL dexamethasone (stock = 20ug/mL)
