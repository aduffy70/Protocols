title: Quantifying DNA with Qubit
categories: protocol
---

Based on instructions from Hardeep Rai

Equipment and supplies are in the Mock lab.

In the drawer by the Qubit:
  * Buffer solution (clear plastic jar)
  * Reagent/dye BR (light sensitive in 1.5mL tubes  in white freezer box)
  * Equipment manuals

In the fridge in the 1st bay:
  * BR standards (low & high) (in 1.5ml tubes in a white freezer box)

1. Label clear 0.7mL tubes:
  * One for each sample
  * One for the low standard
  * One for the high standard.
1. Mix 200uL of working solution for each sample, plus extra for pipette loss (199uL buffer solution : 1uL reagent/dye BR)
1. To each labeled sample tube add 198uL working solution + 2uL vortexed sample
1. To each labeled standard tube add 190uL working solution and 10uL vortexed standard
1. Vortex each tube
1. Let rest for 2 minutes
1. Return reagents to dark storage or the fridge as appropriate
1. Power on the Qubit by pressing ‘Go’
1. Select ‘dsDNA BR’
1. Follow the onscreen instructions to calibrate with the standards and measure the samples.
  * After reading the first sample, arrow down to tell the machine we want the concentration and give it the amount of sample used (2uL)
  * The machine provides readings in ug/mL which is equivalent to ng/uL.
1. When finished, press Home to power down the Qubit. Dispose of tubes as normal lab waste
