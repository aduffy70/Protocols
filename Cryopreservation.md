# Cryopreservation media for preserving primary hepatocytes
10% DMSO, 10% FBS, 0.2M Trehalose dihydrate

  * 1mL DMSO
  * 1mL Fetal Bovine Serum
  * 760mg trehalose dihydrate
  * Cells in Supplemented William's E media (or appropriate growth media) to 10mL

1. Aliquot in cryotubes.
1. Note estimated number of cells on the tube.
1. Freeze 24 hours at -80 in Nalgene Cryo 1C freezing container (to control rate of temperature change and minimize formation of ice crystals).
1. Transfer to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.


To use cells:
1. Thaw in 37C water bath.
1. Centrifuge at 50G for 1 minute.
1. Remove cryopreservation media and replace with appropriate growth media.
1. Optionally, repeat spin/media change to wash.
